detail_tut_01,ruin;ruins;castle,room_tut_03," A fair bit out from the rocky shores you can make out the foggy
 outlines of a ruined castle. The once mighty towers have crumbled and
 it presents a jagged shape against the rainy sky. The ruin is perched
 on its own cliff, only connected to the mainland by means of an old
 hanging bridge starting not far east from you."
detail_tut_02,sea;ocean;waves,room_tut_03," The gray sea stretches as far as the eye can see to the east. Far
 below you its waves crash against the foot of the cliff. The vast
 inland moor meets the ocean along a high and uninviting coastline of
 ragged vertical stone.

 Once this part of the world might have been beautiful, but now the
 eternal winds and storms have washed it all down into a gray and
 barren wasteland."
detail_tut_03,shutters;storm,room_tut_04,The shutters are closed.
detail_tut_04,inn;sign,room_tut_04," You think you might have heard of this name before,
 but at the moment you can recall where from."
detail_tut_05,snake;letters;writing,room_tut_04," The snake is cartoonish with big googly eyes. It looks somewhat
 like one of those big snakes from the distant jungles - the kind
 squeezes their victims."
detail_tut_06,barkeep;man;landlord,room_tut_05," The landlord is a cheerful fellow, always ready to supply you with
 more beer. He mentions doing some sort of arcane magic known as
 ""software development"" when not running this place. Whatever that
 means."
detail_tut_07,brush;brushes,room_tut_07,"The brushes covering the ledge are gray and dwarfed from constantly
 being pummeled by salt, rain and wind."
detail_tut_08,below;sea;ocean;waves,room_tut_07," Below you the gray sea rages, its waves crashing into the cliff so a
 thin mist of salt mixes with the rain even this far above it. You can
 almost imagine the cliff trembling under its onslaught."
detail_tut_09,bridge,room_tut_07," Partly obscured by the rain you can make out the shape of the hanging
 bridge high above you. There is no way to get back up there from this
 ledge."
detail_tut_10,pool;water,room_tut_08," The water of the pool is black and opaque. The rain coming down from
 above does not seem to ripple the surface quite as much as it should."
detail_tut_11,bucket,room_tut_08," The bucket is nearly coming apart, only rusty iron bands holding
 the rotten wood together. It's been down here for a long time."
detail_tut_12,hole;above,room_tut_08," Whereas the lower edges of the hole seem jagged and natural you can
 faintly make out it turning into a man-made circular shaft higher up.
 It looks like an old well. There must have been much more water
 here once."
detail_tut_13,passages;dark,room_tut_08," Those dark passages seem to criss-cross the cliff. No need to
 head back into the gloom now that there seems to be a way out."
detail_tut_14,iron-cast door;iron;door;iron-cast,room_tut_09," The door is very solid and clad in iron. No matter how much you push
 at it, it won't budge. It actually doesn't show any signs of having
 been opened for a very long time."
detail_tut_15,stone walls;walls;stone;stones;wall,room_tut_09," The walls are dripping with moisture and mold. A network of roots
 have burst through the cracks on one side, bending the stones
 slightly aside. You feel a faint draft from that direction."
detail_tut_16,portoculis;fall;fallen;grating,room_tut_10," This heavy iron grating used to block off the inner part of the gate house, now it has fallen
 to the ground together with the stone archway that once help it up."
detail_tut_17,stables;stable;building,room_tut_13," The building is empty, if it was indeed once a stable it was abandoned long ago."
detail_tut_18,altar,room_tut_14," The altar is a massive stone slab. It might once have had ornate decorations
 but time and the salty air has broken everything down into dust."
detail_tut_19,ceiling,room_tut_14, The dome still looming intact above you is a marvel of engineering.
