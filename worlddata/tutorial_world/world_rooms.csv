room_tut_01,Intro,tut#01,tutorial_world.rooms.IntroRoom," {gWelcome to the Evennia tutorial!{n


 The following tutorial consists of a small single-player quest
 area. The various rooms are designed to show off some of the power
 and possibilities of the Evennia mud creation system. At any time
 during this tutorial you can use the {wtutorial{n (or {wtut{n)
 command to get some background info about the room or certain objects
 to see what is going on ""behind the scenes"".


 To get into the mood of this miniature quest, imagine you are an
 adventurer out to find fame and fortune. You have heard rumours of an
 old castle ruin by the coast. In its depth a warrior princess was
 buried together with her powerful magical weapon - a valuable prize,
 if it's true.  Of course this is a chance to adventure that you
 cannot turn down!

 You reach the coast in the midst of a raging thunderstorm. With wind
 and rain screaming in your face you stand where the moor meet the sea
 along a high, rocky coast ...


 {g(write 'start' or 'begin' to start the tutorial. Try 'tutorial'
 to get behind-the-scenes help anywhere.){n",," You just tried the tutorial command. Use it in various rooms to see
what's technically going on and what you could try in each room. The
intro room assigns some properties to your character, like a simple
""health"" property used when fighting. Other rooms and puzzles might do
the same. Leaving the tutorial world through any of the normal exit
rooms will clean away all such temporary properties.

If you play this scenario as superuser, you will see a big red
warning.  This warning is generated in the intro-rooms Typeclass."
room_tut_02,Leaving Tutorial,,tutorial_world.rooms.OutroRoom," You are quitting the Evennia tutorial prematurely! Please come back
 later.",," This outro room cleans up properties on the character that was set by
 the tutorial."
room_tut_03,Cliff by the coast,cliff;tut#02,tutorial_world.rooms.WeatherRoom," You stand on the high coast line overlooking a stormy {wsea{n far
 below. Around you the ground is covered in low gray-green grass,
 pushed flat by wind and rain. Inland, the vast dark moors begin, only
 here and there covered in patches of low trees and brushes.

 To the east, you glimpse the ragged outline of a castle {wruin{n. It sits
 perched on a sheer cliff out into the water, isolated from the
 shore. The only way to reach it seems by way of an old hanging bridge,
 anchored not far east from here.",," Weather room

 This room inherits from a parent called WeatherRoom. It uses the
 tickerhandler to regularly 'tick and randomly display various
 weather-related messages.

 The room also has 'details' set on it (such as the ruin in the distance), those
 are snippets of text stored on the room that the custom look command
 used for all tutorial rooms can display."
room_tut_04,Outside Evennia Inn,outside inn;tut#03,tutorial_world.rooms.WeatherRoom," You stand outside a one-story sturdy wooden building. Light flickers
 behind closed storm shutters. Over the door a sign creaks in the wind
 - the writing says {cEvennia Inn{n and the curly letters are
 surrounded by a painted image of some sort of snake.  From inside you
 hear the sound of laughter, singing and loud conversation.",
room_tut_05,The Evennia Inn,evennia inn;inn;tut#04,tutorial_world.rooms.TutorialRoom,"The Evennia Inn consists of one large room filled with
 tables. The bardisk extends along the east wall, where multiple
 barrels and bottles line the shelves. The barkeep seems busy handing
 out ale and chatting with the patrons, which are a rowdy and cheerful
 lot, keeping the sound level only just below thunderous. This is a
 rare spot of warmth and mirth on this dread moor.


 Soon you have a beer in hand and are chatting with the locals. Your
 eye falls on a {wbarrel{n in a corner with a few old rusty weapons
 sticking out. There is a sign next to it: {wFree to take{n. A patron
 tells you cheerfully that it's the leftovers from those foolish
 adventurers that challenged the old ruin before you ...

 (to get a weapon from the barrel, use {wget weapon{n)
",," Nothing special about this room, only a bonus place to potentially go
 for chatting with other online players. Oh, and don't forget to grab
 a blade if you don't already have one."
room_tut_06,The old bridge,bridge;tut#05,tutorial_world.rooms.BridgeRoom,,"{'west_exit':'tut#02','east_exit':'tut#09','fall_exit':'tut#06'}"," All of the bridge is actually a single room that uses a custom cmdset
 to overrule the movement commands. This makes it take several steps to
 cross it despite it being only one room in the database.


 The bridge has no normal exits, instead it has a counter that tracks
 how far out on the bridge the Character is. For the bridge to work it
 needs the names of links to the adjoining rooms, and when the counter
 indicates the Character is leaving the bridge, they are teleported
 there.


 The room also inherits from the weather room to cause the bridge to
 sway at regular intervals. It also implements a timer and a random
 occurrence at every step across the bridge. It might be worth trying
 this passage a few times to see what may happen.  Hint: you can fall
 off!"
room_tut_07,Protruding ledge,cliffledge;ledge;tut#06,," You are on a narrow ledge protruding from the side of the cliff,
 about halfway down.  The air is saturated with salty sea water,
 sprays hitting your face from the crashing waves {wbelow{n.

 The ledge is covered with a few black-grey brushes. Not far from you
 the cliff-face is broken down to reveal a narrow natural opening into
 the cliff. High above you the {wbridge{n sways and creaks in the wind.",," This room is stored as an attribute on the 'Bridge' room and used as
 a destination should the player fall off the bridge. It is the only
 way to get to this room. In our example the bridge is relatively
 simple and always drops us to the same ledge; a more advanced
 implementation might implement different locations to end up in
 depending on what happens on the bridge."
room_tut_08,Underground passages,passages;underground;tut#07,tutorial_world.rooms.TutorialRoom," The underground cavern system you have entered seems to stretch on
 forever, with criss-crossing paths and natural caverns probably
 carved by water. It is not completely dark, here and there faint
 daylight sifts down from above - the cliff is porous leaving channels
 of air and light up to the surface.


 (some time later)


 You eventually come upon a cavern with a black pool of stale
 water. In it sits a murky bucket, the first remnant of any sort of
 intelligent life down here. The bucket has disconnected from a chain
 hanging down from a circular opening high above. Gray daylight
 simmers down the hole together with rain that ripples the black
 surface of the pool.",," This room acts as a hub for getting the player back to the
 start again, regardless of how you got here."
room_tut_09,Dark cell,dark;cell;tut#08,tutorial_world.rooms.DarkRoom," {YThe {yflickering light{Y of your makeshift light reveals a small square
 cell. It does not seem like you are still in the castle, for the
 stone of the walls are chiseled crudely and drip with water and mold.

 One wall holds a solid iron-cast door. While rusted and covered with
 lichen it seems very sturdy. In a corner lies what might have once
 been a bed or a bench but is now nothing more than a pile of splinters,
 one of which you are using for light. One of the walls is covered with a
 thick cover of black roots having broken through the cracks from the
 outside.{n",," Dark room

 The dark room implements a custom ""dark"" state. This is a very
 restricted state that completely redefines the look command and only
 allows limited interactions.

 Looking around repeatedly will eventually produce hints as to how to
 get out of the dark room. 

This room presents a puzzle that has to be solved in order to get out
 of the room. The root-covered wall is in fact an advanced Exit-type
 object that is locked until the puzzle is solved."
room_tut_10,Ruined gatehouse,gatehouse;tut#09,tutorial_world.rooms.TutorialRoom," The old gatehouse is near collapse. Part of its northern wall has
 already fallen down, together with parts of the fortifications in
 that direction.  Heavy stone pillars hold up sections of ceiling, but
 elsewhere the flagstones are exposed to open sky. Part of a heavy
 portcullis, formerly blocking off the inner castle from attack, is
 sprawled over the ground together with most of its frame.

 {wEast{n the gatehouse leads out to a small open area surrounded by
 the remains of the castle.  There is also a standing archway
 offering passage to a path along the old {wsouth{nern inner wall.",," This is part of a four-room area patrolled by a mob: the guardian of
 the castle. The mob initiates combat if the player stays in the same
 room for long enough.

 Combat itself is a very simple affair which takes advantage of the
 strength of the weapon you use, but dictates a fixed skill for you and
 your enemy. The enemy is quite powerful, so don't stick around too
 long â€¦"
room_tut_11,Along inner wall,inner wall;along;tut#10,tutorial_world.rooms.WeatherRoom," What appears at first sight to be a series of connected rooms
 actually turns out to be collapsed buildings so mashed together by
 the ravages of time that they all seem to lean on each other and
 against the outer wall. The whole scene is directly open to the sky.

 The buildings make a half-circle along the main wall, here and there
 broken by falling stone and rubble. At one end (the {wnorth{nern) of
 this half-circle is the entrance to the castle, the ruined
 gatehoue. {wEast{nwards from here is some sort of open courtyard.",," This is part of a four-room area patrolled by a mob; the guardian of
 the castle. The mob initiates combat if the player stays in the same
 room for long enough.

 Combat itself is a very simple affair which takes advantage of the
 strength of the weapon you use, but dictates a fixed skill for you and
 your enemy."
room_tut_12,Corner of castle ruins,corner;tut#11,tutorial_world.rooms.TutorialRoom," The ruins opens up to the sky in a small open area, lined by
 columns. The open area is dominated by a huge stone {wobelisk{n in its
 center, an ancient ornament miraculously still standing.

 Previously one could probably continue past the obelisk and eastward
 into the castle keep itself, but that way is now completely blocked
 by fallen rubble. To the {wwest{n is the gatehouse and entrance to
 the castle, whereas {wsouth{nwards the collumns make way for a wide
 open courtyard.",,"This is part of a four-room area patrolled by a mob; the guardian of

room_tut_13,Overgrown courtyard,courtyard;tut#12,tutorial_world.rooms.WeatherRoom," The inner courtyard of the old castle is littered with debris and
 overgrown with low grass and patches of thorny vines. There is a
 collapsed structure close to the gatehouse that looks like a stable.

 {wNorth{nwards is a smaller area cornered in the debris, adorned with
 a large obelisk-like thing. To the {wwest{n the castle walls loom
 over a mess of collapsed buildings. On the opposite, {weast{nern side
 of the yard is a large building with a curved roof that seem to have
 withstood the test of time better than many of those around it, it
 looks like some sort of temple.",," This is part of a four-room area patrolled by a mob; the guardian of
 the castle. The mob initiates combat if the player stays in the same

 strength of the weapon you use, but dictates a fixed skill for you and

room_tut_14,The ruined temple,temple;in;tut#13,tutorial_world.rooms.TutorialRoom," This building seems to have survived the ravages of time better than
 most of the others. Its arched roof and wide spaces suggests that
 this is a temple or church of some kind.


 The wide hall of the temple stretches before you. At the far edge is
 a stone altar with no clear markings. Despite its relatively good
 condition, the temple is empty of all furniture or valuables, like it
 was looted or its treasures moved ages ago.

 Stairs lead down to the temple's dungeon on either side of the
 altar. A gaping door opening shows the a wide courtyard to the west.",
room_tut_15,Antechamber,antechamber;tut#14,tutorial_world.rooms.TutorialRoom," This chamber lies almost directly under the main altar of the
 temple. The passage of aeons is felt here and you also sense you are
 close to great power.

 The sides of the chamber are lined with stone archways, these are
 entrances to the {wtombs{n of what must have been influential
 families or individual heroes of the realm. Each is adorned by a
 stone statue or symbol of fine make. They do not seem to be ordered
 in any particular order or rank.",," This is the second part of a puzzle involving the Obelisk in the
 castle's north-east corner. The correct exit to use will vary
 depending on which scene was shown on the Obelisk surface.

 Each tomb is a teleporter room and is keyed to a number corresponding
 to the scene last shown on the obelisk (now stored on player). If the
 number doesn't match, the tomb is a trap that teleports to a second
 Teleporter room describing how you fall in a trap - that room then
 directly relay you on to the Dark Cell. If correct, the tomb
 teleports to the Ancient Tomb treasure chamber."

 The game play given here is of course just scraping the surface of
 what can be done with Evennia. The tutorial focuses more on showing
 various techniques than to supply any sort of novel storytelling or
 gaming challenge.  The full README and source code for the tutorial
 world can be found under {wcontrib/tutorial_world{g.


 If you went through the tutorial quest once, it can be interesting to
 do it again to explore the various possibilities and rooms you might
 not have come across yet, maybe with the source/build code next to
 you.  If you play as superuser (user #1) the mobile will ignore you
 and teleport rooms etc will not affect you (this will also disable all
 locks, so keep that in mind when checking functionality).{n","{'wracklist':['rack_barrel', 'rack_sarcophagus']}"," This room cleans up all temporary attributes and tags that were put
